    Fixed and issue where deployed nodes did not become available over the
    network. This happened when the first network interface was not connected
    to a network with a DHCP service, i.e a secondary network interface was
    used. The addition of network metadata in the instance config solves this
    problem. See bug:
    `2009238 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009238>`_.
