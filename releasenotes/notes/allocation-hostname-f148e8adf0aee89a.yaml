upgrade:
  - |
    An allocation name is now used for hostname instead of a custom ``extra``
    field. Previously deployed instances will no longer be recognized, use
    the allocation backfilling to make them recognized again.
deprecations:
  - |
    The exception classes ``DeploymentFailure``, ``TraitsNotFound`` and
    ``NoNodesReserved`` are deprecated and no longer used after transitioning
    to the allocation API.
