    Fixed an issue where instance metadata for network configuration was not
    correctly written to the config-drive when using a neutron routed
    provider network. The invalid metadata would in most cases cause the
    instance network initialization to completely fail, leaving the instance
    with no network connectivity. See bug: `2009715
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009715>`_.
