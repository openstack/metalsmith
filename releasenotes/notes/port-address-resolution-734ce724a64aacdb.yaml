    Fixes erroneous behavior in metalsmith as it relates to the generation of
    instance metadata where it relies upon the pre-set neutron mac address
    to generate metadata. This is because metalsmith attempts to generate port
    bindings in Neutron and then populate the VIF attachments to Ironic. This
    behavior breaks when Ironic resets MAC addresses as part of early vif
    binding fixes which break Metalsmith's reliance upon incorrect behavior.
    Metalsmith now reconciles against tenant vif attachment record in Ironic,
    and uses that data source for the physical MAC address to feed into network
    metadata generation. More information regarding this issue can be found in
    `bug 2107483 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/metalsmith/+bug/2107483>`_.
