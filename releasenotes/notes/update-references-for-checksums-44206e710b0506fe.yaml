  - |
    During the *bobcat* development cycle, the Ironic community updated the
    MD5 checksum logic in the ``ironic-python-agent`` to be explicitly
    disabled, and added support for the checksums to be conveyed as a
    SHA256 or SHA512 checksum.
    With this upgrade, we have updated our references and playbooks.
